## Overview

Supply-Link is an open-source, blockchain-based supply chain tracker that enables transparent, tamper-proof tracking of products from origin to consumer. It solves the trust and verification crisis in global supply chains by anchoring every product event immutably on the Stellar blockchain.

**Contract Address (Testnet):** `CBUWSKT2UGOAXK4ZREVDJV5XHSYB42PZ3CERU2ZFUTUMAZLJEHNZIECA`

## The Problem

Modern supply chains suffer from deep trust failures:

| Issue | Impact |
|---|---|
| Counterfeit goods | $4.5 trillion lost annually |
| Supply chain fraud | $40+ billion lost annually |
| Counterfeit medications | 250,000+ deaths per year |
| Consumer distrust | 73% don't trust sustainability claims |

Paper trails are forged. Databases are siloed. No single source of truth exists across supply chain participants.

---

## The Solution

Supply-Link provides a decentralized, immutable ledger where every product event â€” harvest, processing, shipping, quality check, retail receipt â€” is recorded on-chain and verifiable by anyone with a QR code scan.

### Core Features

- **Product Registration** â€” Register products at origin with cryptographic proof of authenticity and a unique blockchain ID
- **Event Tracking** â€” Record every supply chain step with timestamp, location, actor address, and metadata
- **QR Verification** â€” Consumers scan a QR code to see the complete, tamper-proof product journey
- **Multi-party Authorization** â€” Farmers, processors, shippers, and retailers each sign their own events
- **Ownership Transfer** â€” Transfer product custody on-chain with full audit trail

## Smart Contract

The Soroban contract exposes these core functions:

```rust
// Register a new product
register_product(env, id, name, origin, owner) -> Product

// Add a tracking event
add_tracking_event(env, product_id, location, event_type, metadata) -> Event

// Read product details
get_product(env, id) -> Product

// Read all events for a product
get_tracking_events(env, product_id) -> Vec<Event>

// Transfer product ownership
transfer_ownership(env, product_id, new_owner) -> bool

// Authorize an actor to add events
add_authorized_actor(env, product_id, actor) -> bool
```

### Data Models

```rust
pub struct Product {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub origin: String,
    pub owner: Address,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub authorized_actors: Vec<Address>,
}

pub struct TrackingEvent {
    pub product_id: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub actor: Address,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub event_type: String,  // HARVEST | PROCESSING | SHIPPING | RETAIL
    pub metadata: String,    // JSON string
}
```

## Why Stellar / Soroban?

| Feature | Stellar | Ethereum | Bitcoin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Finality | ~5 seconds | Minutes | Hours |
| Tx cost | ~$0.00001 | $10â€“100 | High |
| Energy | Efficient PoA | PoS | PoW |
| Cross-border | Native | Limited | Limited |

Stellar's speed and near-zero cost make it ideal for supply chain use cases where thousands of events are recorded per day across global participants.

## Use Cases

- **Food & Agriculture** â€” Track coffee from Ethiopian farm to Seattle cafÃ©, verify organic/fair-trade claims
- **Pharmaceuticals** â€” Verify medication authenticity from factory to pharmacy, prevent counterfeits
- **Fashion** â€” Prove ethical sourcing and fair-wage manufacturing
- **Electronics** â€” Verify conflict-free mineral sourcing
- **Luxury Goods** â€” Authenticate high-value items, track resale ownership
